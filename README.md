Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Prediction from Agrifood Systems

Overview
This repository contains a project analyzing and predicting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (CO2eq) generated from agrifood systems, based on data from the AR5 dataset. The goal of this project is to understand the distribution of emissions, detect outliers, and build predictive models to estimate emissions from different agrifood activities.

Features
•	Data Cleaning & Exploration: Handling missing values, outliers, and understanding the distribution of GHG emissions across various food categories.
•	Visualization: Boxplots and other charts to detect outliers and visualize emission trends.
•	Prediction Models: Machine learning models to predict CO2-equivalent emissions from agrifood systems.
•	Colab Integration: The project is developed in Google Colab for easy experimentation and reproducibility.

Dataset
The dataset includes numeric features such as:
•	CO2 emissions, CH4 emissions, N2O emissions
•	Total GHG emissions
•	Emissions per food category (e.g., cereals, meat, dairy)
•	Other agrifood system indicators

Purpose
•	Understand which activities contribute the most to GHG emissions.
•	Detect abnormal values that could affect analysis or predictions.
•	Build predictive models to support sustainable agrifood system planning.

Tools & Libraries
•	Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
•	Google Colab for interactive development
•	GitHub for version control and repository management
